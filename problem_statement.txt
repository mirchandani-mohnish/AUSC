The idea behind this problem statement is to help students keep a track of
their academic progress. The competitors will have to create a website that
fulfills the following requirements:
● TODOs:
○ Every user can create their list of to-dos to keep track of their tasks
○ Users should be able to add a reminder for each of the tasks

● Admin Panel:
○ Admin can add and design courses
○ Admin can enroll students for those courses

● A page for keeping track of completed courses
○ Display the required credits in each of the course categories like GERs,
core courses, major electives etc
○ Users should be able to add a completed course in each of this
category and the credits requirements should be updated accordingly

● Ratings for courses
○ Users should be able to rate courses on the basis of various features
○ Users should be able to filter out courses based on category, faculties,
credits etc

● Resume maker [brownie]
○ A page that creates a resume ( which follows a ATS approved template
) based on the inputs of the user
