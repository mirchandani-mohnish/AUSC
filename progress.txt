Work Logs 

problem 1 : choice issue -- Unable to understand how the different frameworks work and which would be better for 
    our needs (i.e. two beginners who know nothing about web dev). Django vs Node -- tried both django and node 
    found node easier and more convenient because of common language and open structure -- chose node
    (later found the actual difference and found django to be easier and faster)


problem 2 : unable to select frontend framework bootstrap and tailwind -- understood both the frameworks
    choose bootstrap because of easier implementation 
    tailwind had build structure and built file after css implementation while bootstrap had css classes
    took 2 days

problem 3 : unable to understand node file structure and routers concept -- took lots of time to make simple home page fronted 
    initially did not use routers. and files were unstructured with all ejs files and one main index.js file 
    worked out by talking to seniors and tried to figure out using video tutorials

problem 4 : unable to connect to mongodb and file structure 

problem 5 : unable to login and register -- tried passport bcrypt and jwt

problem 6 : unable to get specific data from mongo
